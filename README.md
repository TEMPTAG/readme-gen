## Description

Do you work your fingers to the bone just to get the project/application done/tested/released, then realize you need to make a comprehensive README file and see it as a huge chore? Then, like the amazingly well-meaning human you are, put it on the ever-growing "ToDo LiSt" that future you can deal with - only to have future you never check off that todo.

Hi, I am Ian Ferguson, and welcome to my world - I mean, project. I know I said "you" a lot in that paragraph, but "you" is me. I am "you." This was the motivation for the project. Looking at all my repos and cool projects with an empty README file or just a sad outline of a README file with no content. I love creating, but READMEs always feel like busy-work, and busy-work is the grim reaper of my creativity. This application takes away the basic formatting tasks and allows me to just fill-in the blanks with helpful information, and communication to you - yes, actually you this time. I love communicating, but I hate the formalities of formatting that communication in an acceptable format for you to read.

So, check out this rad animated .gif showing the functionality of this command-line application putting in the work that all of us seem to avoid, as we all - especially me - continually avoid the grim reapers of creativity...

OH. MY. GOODNESS. Collaborations are amazing. Share ideas, code, etc. with others is the best way to share knowledge, mutual enthusiasms, and a lot of times we make cool friends along the way. I welcome contributions in many ways, shapes, and forms:

- [Email Me](mailto:iansterlingferguson@gmail.com) and just plain tell me what you like, do not like, would like to see changed... just give me a compliment before laying it on me
- FORK IT ALL - create a fork, clone it down, mess it up, do the neato commits and comments, push it back, test it at least a million times, then submit a pull request for me to review and merge into the project if I think you are cool (and the code is cool too) - but again, the nice thing to do would be emailing me first and telling me your intentions... and don't forget the compliment part

Something, something... Have your people call my people. And by call, I mean email - who answers the phone these days?

## Tests

As the above states, please test your changes thoroughly before submitting a pull request or sending it straight to me. As far as tests I have done? None. Zero. Ziltch. I have not learned how to do that yet, so I am relying on you to do your part until I learn how to do mine.
